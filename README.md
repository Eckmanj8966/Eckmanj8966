Hello, my name is Joshua Eckman (Eckmanj8966) and I am a college student studying Information Technology/Computer Programming & Development.
I enjoy building programs and learning new and better ways to make them function.

I am currently learning Linux/UNIX NOX-120, Systems Analysis & Design CTS-285, CSC-113, and AI Fundamentals.

Some personal hobbies of mine include: 
- Drawing
- Cosplay 
- Tabletop wargaming (including Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar)
- Tabletop RPGs (Dungeons & Dragons 5e and Pathfinder 2e)
- 3D Printing
- Video games (especially RPGs)

Fun Fact (something unexpected about you)
- A fun fact about myself is that I am a twin (Though, not the cool kind. I have a fraternal twin sister.)
