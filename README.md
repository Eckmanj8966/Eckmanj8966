Hello, my name is Joshua Eckman (Eckmanj8966) and I am a college student studying Information Technology/Computer Programming & Development. I enjoy building programs and learning new and better ways to make them function.

I am currently learning Linux/UNIX NOX-120, Systems Analysis & Design CTS-285, CSC-113, and AI Fundamentals.

Some personal hobbies of mine include: 
- :Pencil2: Drawing
- :performing_arts: Cosplay
- :crossed_swords: Tabletop wargaming (including Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar)
- :game_die: Tabletop RPGs (Dungeons & Dragons 5e and Pathfinder 2e)
- :printer: 3D Printing
- :video_game: Video games (especially RPGs)

I can be reached at these two email addresses: 
- School: eckmanj8966@student.faytechcc.edu
- Personal: joshuaeckman518@gmail.com

A fun fact about myself is that I am a twin (Though, not the cool kind. I have a fraternal twin sister.)
